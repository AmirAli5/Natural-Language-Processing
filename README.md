# Natural Language Processing
In this Natural Language Processing Repository I have upload three projects Related to Natural Language Processing which I have done. 
#### The following project is:
1.	Text Classification
2.	Twitter Sentiment Analysis
4.	Text  Summarization

#### Natural Language Processing Core
In Natural Language Processing Core I have covers some basic algorithms of NLP.
These algorithm are:
•	Stemming
•	Lemmatization
•	Stop Word Removal
•	Parts of Speech Tagging
•	Named Entity Recognition 
•	Bags of Word Model (BOW)
•	TF-IDF Model
•	N-Gram Model
•	Latent Semantic Analysis
•	Word synonyms and antonyms 
•	Word Negation Tagging

These are project which I have done in NLP.
## Project 1: Text Classification:
Text classification offers a good framework for getting familiar with textual data processing without lacking interest, either. In fact, there are many interesting applications for text classification such as spam detection and sentiment analysis. In this Project I use Cornell sentiment analysis dataset in Text Classification. In data preprocessing I have use TF-IDF model and Bag of Word model .and for predicting the Cornell sentiment analysis dataset in text classification I use powerful machine learning classifier algorithms which is Logistic Regression. In this Cornell sentiment analysis dataset I train 80% for train and 20% for test. On this bases of test achieved 84.75% accuracy. And in the end I check our model to write a simple line of sentence in our model and he predicts the given sentence is positive meaning.

## Project 2: Twitter Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing (product/movie review, tweet, etc.) is positive, negative or neutral. ... Marketers can use sentiment analysis to research public opinion of their company and products, or to analyze customer satisfaction. In this project I fetch the last 100 tweets of Google and analysis the sentiment of different tweets. I use tweepy library and pickle file of TF-IDF model for twitter sentiment analysis. And in the end visualize the result into two categories positive and negative.

## Project 3: Text Summarization:
Text summarization is the problem of creating a short, accurate, and fluent summary of a longer text document. Examples of text summarization you may encounter every single day. The application and promise of deep learning methods for automatic text summarization. In this project I take the whole information of Pakistan Super League from Wikipedia and summarize it into short paragraph using the Text Summarization model.
