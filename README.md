# Natural Language Processing
In this Natural Language Processing Repository I have upload three projects Related to Natural Language Processing which I have done. 
#### The following project is:
1.	Text Classification
2.	Second Project is 
3.	Twitter Sentiment Analysis
4.	Text  Summarization

#### Natural Language Processing Core
In Natural Language Processing Core I have covers some basic algorithms of NLP.
These algorithm are:
•	Stemming
•	Lemmatization
•	Stop Word Removal
•	Parts of Speech Tagging
•	Named Entity Recognition 
•	Bags of Word Model (BOW)
•	TF-IDF Model
•	N-Gram Model
•	Latent Semantic Analysis
•	Word synonyms and antonyms 
•	Word Negation Tagging

These are project which I have done in NLP.
## Project 1: Text Classification:
Text classification offers a good framework for getting familiar with textual data processing without lacking interest, either. In fact, there are many interesting applications for text classification such as spam detection and sentiment analysis. In this Project I use Cornell sentiment analysis dataset in Text Classification. In data preprocessing I have use TF-IDF model and Bag of Word model .and for predicting the Cornell sentiment analysis dataset in text classification I use powerful machine learning classifier algorithms which is Logistic Regression. In this Cornell sentiment analysis dataset I train 80% for train and 20% for test. On this bases of test achieved 84.75% accuracy. And in the end I check our model to write a simple line of sentence in our model and he predicts the given sentence is positive meaning.
