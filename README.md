# Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. In this Repository, I have uploaded the NLP based Project which I have done. 
#### The following projects are:
1.	Text Classification
2.	Twitter Sentiment Analysis
4.	Text  Summarization  

#### Natural Language Processing Core
In Natural Language Processing Core I have covered all the modules of NLP that we use during text Preprocessing.
These algorithms are:
•	Stemming
•	Lemmatization
•	Stop Word Removal
•	Parts of Speech Tagging
•	Named Entity Recognition 
•	Bags of Word Model (BOW)
•	TF-IDF Model
•	N-Gram Model
•	Latent Semantic Analysis
•	Word synonyms and antonyms 
•	Word Negation Tagging

#### These are projects which I have done in NLP:
## Project 1: Text Classification of movies review comments
Text classification offers a good framework for getting familiar with textual data processing without lacking interest, either. In fact, there are many interesting applications for text classification such as spam detection and sentiment analysis. In this project, I use the Cornell sentiment analysis dataset in Text Classification. In data preprocessing I have to use the TF-IDF model and Bag of Word model .and for predicting the Cornell sentiment analysis dataset in text classification I use powerful machine learning classifier algorithms which are Logistic Regression. In this Cornell sentiment analysis dataset, I train 80% for train and 20% for tests. On this bases of test achieved 84.75% accuracy. And in the end, I check our model to write a simple line of the sentence in our model and he predicts the given sentence.

## Project 2: Twitter Sentiment Analysis of Google review
Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing (product/movie review, tweet, etc.) is positive, negative or neutral. ... Marketers can use sentiment analysis to research public opinion of their company and products or to analyze customer satisfaction. In this project, I fetch the last 100 tweets of Google and analysis the sentiment of different tweets. I used tweepy library and pickle file of the TF-IDF model for twitter sentiment analysis. And in the end, visualize the result into two categories positive and negative.

## Project 3: Text Summarization of Pakistan Super League Wikipedia
Text summarization is the problem of creating a short, accurate, and fluent summary of a longer text document. Examples of text summarization you may encounter every single day. The application and promise of deep learning methods for automatic text summarization. In this project, I take the whole information of the Pakistan Super League from the Wikipedia site and summarize it into a short paragraph using the Machine Learning models.
